        <h1>I Don't Deserve Your Eyes On This</h1>
        <p>Dear Niya,</p>
        I have created this website to store my apology to you forever in the archives of the internet, and also as a live update for you on what changes and efforts I'm making to improve myself and become a better human being.
      <p>Whatever I did, I regret it, I'm going to regret it my entire life...and I aplogize for everything.</p>
        You were my source of light and happiness for a very long time. You gave me the love I never deserved, but in return, I failed you completely - not just as a partner, but as a human being.
      <p>This isn't me begging for another chance (God knows I don't deserve it). It's me finally seeing clearly:

How my "love" became a prison for you

, how "I miss you" turned into weapons

, how someone as radiant as you dimmed your light to survive my storms</p>



    <div class="growth-section">
        <h2>Concrete Changes I'm Making</h2>
        <h3>Completed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>‚úÖ Journal analyzing my patterns</li>
            <li>‚úÖ Deleted everything I had on you permanently</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ongoing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>üì± Digital detox periods to prevent impulsive actions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="letter-section">
        <h2>Final Words</h2>
        <p>I know forgiveness might never come - and that's okay. 
          <p>I look at it now and want to scream at myself from past: "Can't you see she's giving you her WHOLE HEART? Don't ruin this!" </p> But I did. Over and over. You were my first real love. I became your worst mistake. All I can do now is stay gone, stay better, and hope karma gives you twice the joy you gave me.

        <p>
        <em>You showed me darkness in myself I must now confront.</em></p>
